"""MXS Remastered engine sound packs.

MX Simulator plays a bike's engine from a soundtable: a grid of RPMs by throttle levels, each cell a
recording (.sw: raw signed 16-bit mono) of the engine's cycle there. Almost every cell holds a single
cycle, looped, which is why the engines sound bland: every cycle is exactly the same. The format takes
more ("-1 <cycles> @file", then the order to play them in); only the stock idle loops use it.

This makes, for each stock engine, a pack whose soundtable gives every single-cycle cell 16 cycles
instead: the stock recording, varied cycle by cycle the way a real engine varies (how hard each one
fires, its timing, the rasp of the exhaust, the intake's hiss, the odd pop off the throttle), with
the cycles' starts and ends left exactly as recorded so any of them follows any other seamlessly.
Cells that already have many cycles (the idle loops) are kept as they are.

The packs override the stock soundtables by name (default450f.soundtable, ...) from an archive of
their own; no stock file is touched. The mod's panel (OTHER tab, SOUND MODS) installs and removes
them.

    python make_engine_sounds.py "C:\\Games\\MX Simulator" [out_dir]

The 250 four-stroke pack is made from a sound mod's recordings instead: make_250f.py.

Writes <out_dir>/mxsr_engine_<engine>.pack (a .saf, named so the game never loads it by itself)
and preview_<engine>.wav: each RPM's full-throttle sound, first stock, then the pack's, to listen to.
