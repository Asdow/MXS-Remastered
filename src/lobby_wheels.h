// lobby_wheels.h
//   Every bike's wheels in the scene, whatever the model, for tire marks on every bike in a lobby
//   (Config::marksEveryBike): a wheel is a rigid draw whose copies keep turning about one fixed axis
//   of their own, from frame to frame, as they move (in a replay of 22 YZ450s: the two wheel meshes,
//   turning 87-100% of the frames about the same axle every time, against 1-8% about axes that kept
//   changing for every other part of the bikes). Each wheel mesh's axle and tire radius come from its
//   own vertices, so each copy's contact with the ground is known, and its path from frame to frame
//   is handed to the tire marks as segments.
