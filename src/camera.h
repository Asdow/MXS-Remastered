//   The helmet-cam physics. Fed the game's raw view matrix once per frame, it returns an
//   eye-space correction matrix C such that  C * RawView == DynamicView.
//
//   Because C is applied in eye space, the same C is correct for every object drawn that
//   frame:  C * (RawView * Model) == DynamicView * Model.  That's what lets the hooks apply
//   it to every modelview load without knowing which object is which.
