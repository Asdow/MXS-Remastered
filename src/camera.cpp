// camera.cpp
//   Per-frame pipeline. Every filter steps by the smoothed frame interval (FrameTick), so a
//   frame that happens to be measured a millisecond long or short doesn't make the view judder.
//   Orient - everything about where the view points. It only needs the raw camera rotation,
//            so it can also be *previewed* from the sky, which is drawn before the camera
//            position is known. A preview works on a copy of the filter state and changes
//            nothing; only Update() (the terrain, once per frame) advances the filters. So an
//            odd rotation-only draw can't step or reset them, and the sky always gets exactly
//            the rotation the rest of the frame gets.
//     1. decompose       - raw view matrix -> head orientation (quaternion)
//     2. cut detection   - camera switches / look-key snaps skip the smoothing for one frame
//     3. attitude        - heading / pitch / roll of the game camera and, when the tracker has
//                          found it, of the rider's bike (bike.cpp)
//     4. target view     - game camera:   the game's view with pitch lock and horizon lock
//                          custom camera: a view built from the bike alone (the game's 1st
//                                         person angle and gimbal play no part), with the
//                                         locks, our own look-down angle and the game's
//                                         look-left / right / back passed through;
//                          both: air looseness (the nose's swing filtered in the air),
//                                head position offsets
//     5. smoothing       - exponential slerp toward the target, with a lag limit; head nod
//   FinishFrame - where the eye is.
//     6. motion          - velocity and acceleration of the eye (least-squares fit, motion.h);
//                          airborne detection
//     7. neck physics    - vertical low-pass + spring-damper driven by vertical acceleration
//     8. rebuild         - new view matrix, and correction C = NewView * inverse(RawView)
